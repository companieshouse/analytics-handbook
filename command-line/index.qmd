The command line is a powerful tool for interacting with your computer's operating system. It allows us to perform tasks, navigate files and directories, and execute programs â€” all through text-based commands.

## Getting Help

When you're unsure about how to use a command, you can often find helpful information by appending `-h` or `--help` after the command. For example, typing `ls --help` will display information about the `ls` command, which lists directory contents.

## Basic Commands

There are several fundamental commands you'll frequently use on the command line. Here are some of the most common ones:

- `echo` prints a string to the terminal.
- `ls -a` lists all files, including hidden ones.
- `cd` changes the current directory.
- `mkdir` creates a new directory.
- `code .` opens the current directory in Visual Studio Code.
- `cp` copies a file.
- `mv` moves a file.
- `rm` removes a file.
- `touch` creates a new file.
- `cat` displays the contents of a file.
- `less` displays the contents of a file, one page at a time.
- `head` displays the first few lines of a file.
- `tail` displays the last few lines of a file.
- `grep` searches for a string in a file.

## Handy Shortcuts

Remembering a few keyboard shortcuts can make your command line experience smoother:

- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>: Stops the currently running command.
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd>: Clears the screen, providing a clean slate.
