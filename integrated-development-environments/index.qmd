Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are tools for coding. They bring together everything needed for writing, testing, and fixing code.

[Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](/integrated-development-environments/vscode.qmd) is a popular IDE for various coding tasks. It supports many programming languages and is highly customisable and extendable.

Some analysts, particularly R users, may prefer [RStudio](/integrated-development-environments/rstudio.qmd). RStudio is tailored for R users but can also handle Python and other languages.

We have guidance on setting up [VS Code](/integrated-development-environments/vscode.qmd) and [RStudio](/integrated-development-environments/rstudio.qmd).
