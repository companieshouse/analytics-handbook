Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is popular among writers, developers, and analysts for its simplicity and ease of use. It allows you to format text using plain text syntax that can be easily converted to HTML or other formats. Analysts often use Markdown to document analyses, write reports, and create reproducible research documents.

[Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) is the most comprehensive resource for learning Markdown. It provides detailed instructions and examples for using Markdown to format text, create lists, tables, and more.

### Headings

Use the `#` symbol to create headings. The number of `#` symbols indicates the level of the heading.

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```

### Emphasis

To emphasise text, use asterisks (`*`) or underscores (`_`).

- *Italic* text: `*italic*` or `_italic_`
- **Bold** text: `**bold**` or `__bold__`

### Lists

#### Unordered Lists

Create unordered lists using hyphens (`-`), asterisks (`*`), or plus signs (`+`).

```markdown
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 2.1
  - Subitem 2.2
```

#### Ordered Lists

Create ordered lists using numbers followed by a period.

```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item
   1. Subitem 2.1
   2. Subitem 2.2
```

### Links

Create hyperlinks using square brackets for the text and parentheses for the URL.

```markdown

```

### Images

Embed images using an exclamation mark followed by square brackets for the alt text and parentheses for the URL.

```markdown
![Markdown logo](https://www.markdownguide.org/assets/images/tux.png)
```

### Blockquotes

Create blockquotes using the `>` symbol.

```markdown
> This is a blockquote.
> It can span multiple lines.
```

### Code

Inline code can be created using backticks (`` ` ``).

```markdown
Use the `code` keyword to include code inline.
```

For code blocks, use triple backticks (` ``` `). You can also include the language name alongside the backticks, and some programs will attempt to provide syntax highlighting for that language.

````markdown
```python
print("Hello, Markdown!")
```
````

### Tables

Create tables using pipes (`|`) and hyphens (`-`).

```markdown
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data     | More data|
| Row 2    | Data     | More data|
```

### Horizontal Rules

Create horizontal rules using three or more hyphens (`---`), asterisks (`***`), or underscores (`___`).

```markdown
